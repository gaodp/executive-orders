 

THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

The State of Georgia’s current 9-1-1 funding model was created and
authorized by the Georgia General Assembly in 1977, at a time when
most homes and businesses had land lines with several extensions;
and

At the time of creation and authorization of the current 9-1-1
funding model, monthly 9-1-1 charges were billed to the home or
business location where those land lines were installed, assuring
each local jurisdiction of regular revenues from those residence or
business accounts located therein; and

In 1977, the General Assembly set a cap of $1.50 a month per phone
line for 9-1-1 services, which is still in place today; and

Since 1977, the advent and exponential growth of cellular/wireless
telephone users created an enormously mobile customer base,
forcing 9-1-1 call centers to handle an overwhelming number of 9-1-
1 calls from mobile customers that cannot be billed on either a
month or per call basis; and

This effect, combined with large commuter or Visitor demand for 9-
1-1 services, leave large metropolitan centers like Atlanta and
Savannah with no method to recover the costs of providing 9-1-1
services.

Now, THEREFORE, BY VIRTUE OF THE POWER VESTED IN ME AS
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

The Governor’s Commission on 9-1-1 System Modernization and
Balanced Funding Model is hereby created for the purpose of
making recommendations for the updating of the 9-1-1 funding
model to reﬂect current and evolving technology.
