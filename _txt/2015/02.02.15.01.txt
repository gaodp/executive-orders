vacancies in the courts arising during the Governor’s term of ofﬁce; and

the highest capacity Whom by temperament, ability and integrity will freely,
impartially, and independently interpret the law and administer justice; and

outstanding lawyers and laypersons in aid to the discretion reposed in the
Governor, drawn from all quarters of the State and a cross—section of its diverse
population best ensures the highest quality of judicial appointments.
