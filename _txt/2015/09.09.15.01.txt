 

THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

WHEREAS:

WI IEREAS 3

WHEREAS:

FLAGS ON ALL STATE BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS
ORDERED LOWERED T0 HALF-STAFF

Fourteen years ago on September 11, 2001, 17 individuals attempted to alter
the course of our great nation. Their cowardly attack, uniquely barbaric and
hostile to all mankind, claimed the lives of 2,977 men, women, and children.
On this anniversary, we the citizens of the United States of America honor
and remember those lost, and grieve alongside the loved ones they left
behind; and

The 9/11 attacks targeted the God—given rights of those 2,977 people, the
inalienable rights enshrined in our very Declaration of Independence: the
right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In the immediate
aftermath of the tragedy, police officers, firefighters, and first responders
set a powerful precedent, reacting to the tragedy and in defiance of evil with
courage, resolve, and love. It is this precedent which the citizens of the
United States of America must reaffirm with every passing year, lest the
attackers succeed in altering our American way of life at the expense of our
lives, liberties, and happiness; and

For their innocent sacrifice, we owe those 2,977 men, women, and children
a time of reﬂection and honor. We owe their loved ones our thoughts and
prayers. We owe their children, grandchildren, and fellow citizens a United
States of America committed to securing the lives and rights of its people in
the face of those who would eviscerate our way of life. We owe them
courage, resolve, love, and a day of honor and remembrance. To this end,
the United States Congress passed Public Law 107—89, designating
September 11 of every year “Patriot Day,” and by Public Law 111—13,
requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized
“National Day of Service and Remembrance.”
