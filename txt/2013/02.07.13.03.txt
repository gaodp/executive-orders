skills to empower them to: graduate from high school; be successful in
college and / or professional careers; and to be competitive with their peers
throughout the United States and the world; and

$19.4 million of Georgia’s Race to the Top award was set aside to create
the Georgia Race to the Top Innovation Fund, a competitive grant
program to promote partnerships between local education authorities or
charter schools, institutions of higher education, businesses, and
nonprofit organizations that develop or implement innovative and high-
impact programs aimed producing positive outcomes for students; and

creatively leverage applicants’ resources to raise student achievement
through the development and delivery of applied learning opportunities
and experiences directly tied to a subject matter, especially in the ﬁelds of
