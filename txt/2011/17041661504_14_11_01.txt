 

THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

The State of Georgia holds title to certain real property by virtue of a
February 12, 1931 warranty deed from Joseph, Samuel and Frank
Goldberg for approximately 456 acres recorded in Richmond
County Clerk’s of Superior Court in Deed Book 12-B, Pages 586-
588; and

Approximately 210 acres of that real property in Richmond County
includes those facilities known as the Augusta Youth Development
Center and the Augusta Regional Youth Detention Center (the
“Property”), as described in Exhibit “A”, attached hereto and
incorporated herein by reference; and

Said Property is in the custody of the Georgia Department of Juvenile
Justice; and

The Old Special Services Building #5, the Old Power Plant Building
#15, the Old Laundry Building #17, the Old Medical Building #25,
and the Old Housing Buildings numbers 35, 36 and 37 (the
Structures) located on the Property, as described in Exhibit B, were
found by the Department of Juvenile Justice to be more expensive to
repair and renovate to current Department Juvenile Justice
construction and operations standards and needs than their inherent
worth, and were declared by the Board of Juvenile Justice to be
unserviceable and abandoned in their entirety; and

The Board of the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice on March
24, 2011 resolved that it has no plans to use the Structures for any
future purpose, and the Department of Juvenile Justice requested
that the State Properties Commission seek an Executive Order from
the Governor to allow for the razing, demolition, and disposal of the
Structures as in the best interest of the State of Georgia; and
