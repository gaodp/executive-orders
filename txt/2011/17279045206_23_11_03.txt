WHEREAS :

WHEREAS :

WHEREAS :

ORDERED:

Motor fuels and aviation gasoline are essential commodities used by Georgians for
transportation; and

The price of gasoline has increased dramatically since the adjournment of the 2011
General Assembly; and

The increases in the cost of gasoline and other motor fuels have and will continue to
impose signiﬁcant ﬁnancial burdens on all Georgians and Georgia's businesses; and

This inﬂated cost can prevent Georgians from spending on other necessary goods
and business expansion; and

The signiﬁcant increase in motor fuel prices will result in a windfall to the State in the
form of surplus state taxes on these commodities; and

Georgia law authorizes the Governor to suspend the collection of taxes, or any part
thereof, due the state until the meeting of the next General Assembly; and

Under these circumstances, relief to the taxpayers of Georgia is warranted.

Now, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME A GOVERNOR
OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, AND BY SEC'I‘ION 45-12-22 OF THE OFFICIAL CODE
OF GEORGIA ANNOTATED, 1T Is HEREBY

That the collection of any rate of prepaid state taxes as deﬁned in paragraph (5.1) of
Section 48-8-2 of the Ofﬁcial Code of Georgia Annotated, to the extent it differs from
the rate levied as of May 1, 2011 pursuant to Section 48-9-14 of the Ofﬁcial Code of
Georgia Annotated, be suspended as it applies to sales of motor fuel and aviation
gasoline as those terms are deﬁned in Section 48-9-2 of the Ofﬁcial Code of Georgia
Annotated, ending the last moment of December 31, 2011.

This  day ofJune, 2011.
