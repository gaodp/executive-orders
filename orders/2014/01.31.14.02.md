THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

ORDERED:

The uninterrupted supply of emergency or disaster related materials, supplies,
goods and services (to include any agricultural or other food products) is an
essential need of the public during the winter and any interruption threatens the
public welfare; and

The continued period of severe winter weather has increased the demand for the
above referenced products and threatened the uninterrupted delivery of these
products; and

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations, 49 CFR 390, et seq., limit the hours
of operators of commercial motor vehicles may drive; and

49 CFR 390.23 allows the Governor of a State to suspend these rules and
regulations for up to 30 days if the Governor determines that an emergency
condition exists.

NOW, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS GOVERNOR
OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That a State of Emergency is hereby declared for the limited purpose of
suspending the federal rules and regulations that limit the hours operators of
commercial vehicles may drive, in order to ensure the uninterrupted supply of
emergency or disaster related materials, supplies, goods and services (to include
any agricultural or other food products) throughout Georgia. This emergency
justifies a suspension of Part 395 (drivers’ hours of service) of Title 49 of the Code
of Federal Regulations. The suspension shall remain in effect for 14 days or until
the emergency condition ceases to exist, whichever is less. Nothing herein shall
be construed as an exemption from the Commercial Driver’s License
requirements in 49 CFR 383, the financial requirements in 49 CFR 387, or
applicable federal size and weight limitations.

IT IS FURTHER

That no motor carrier operating under the terms of this emergency declaration
shall require or allow an ill or fatigued driver to operate a motor vehicle. A driver
who notifies a motor carrier that he or she needs immediate rest shall be given at
least 10 consecutive hours off-duty before the driver is required to return to
service.
