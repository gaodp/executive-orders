THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

ORDERED:

The uninterrupted supply of emergency and disaster—related materials, supplies,
goods and services (to include agricultural and all other food-related products) is
an essential need of the public during the winter and any interruption threatens
the public welfare; and

The continued period of cold weather and severe winter storms has increased the
demand for the above referenced products and threatened uninterrupted delivery
to residential and commercial customers; and

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations, 49 CFR 390, et seq., limit the hours
of operators of commercial motor vehicles may drive; and

49 CFR 390.23 allows the Governor of a State to suspend these rules and
regulations for up to 30 days if the Governor determines that an emergency
condition exists.

Now, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS GOVERNOR
OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That a State of Emergency was declared for the above purposes on January 31,
2014 and is hereby extended for the limited purpose of suspending the federal
rules and regulations that limit the hours operators of commercial vehicles may
drive, in order to ensure the uninterrupted supply of agriculture related products
throughout Georgia. This emergency justifies a suspension of Part 395 (drivers’
hours of service) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The suspension
shall remain in effect for 7 days or until the emergency condition ceases to exist,
whichever is less. Nothing herein shall be construed as an exemption from the
Commercial Driver’s License requirements in 49 CFR 383, the financial
requirements in 49 CFR ag 387,or applicable federal size and weight limitations.

IT IS FURTHER
That no motor carrier operating under the terms of this emergency declaration

shall require or allow an ill or fatigued driver to operate a motor vehicle. A driver
who notiﬁes a motor carrier that he or she needs immediate rest shall be given at
