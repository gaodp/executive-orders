WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

On January 28, 2014, the State of Georgia and, in particular, the Metro
Atlanta area experienced significant winter weather causing major snowfall
and ice buildup on roads, bridges and other thoroughfares; and

This significant winter weather caused major problems in the area of public
safety and traffic congestion; and

There is a necessity to review and assess the State of Georgia’s response to
this major winter weather event, as well as prior events, to determine how the
State and local governments may be better prepared for and respond during
signiﬁcant winter weather events; and

Task Force representatives encompass individuals from a diverse background
(both public and private) with expertise in predicting, preparing for and
working through severe weather situations which may lead to loss of life or
harm to individuals or impact personal property; and

The purpose of the Task Force is to better prepare the state, its communities
and resources, for severe weather. It will specifically examine information
gathering and weather predictions and how that information is used and
implemented during severe weather events. The Task Force will identify
measures for:

0 Preparing for Emergency Situations (long term and on—going
preparations)
Severe weather warnings and predictions
Communications and coordinating around severe weather
Actions needed once the warnings occur

NOW, THEREFORE, BY VIRTUE OF THE POWER VESTED IN ME AS
