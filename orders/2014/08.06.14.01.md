FLAGS ON STATE CAPITOL BUILDING AND GROUNDS
ORDERED LOWERED TO HALF STAFF

The Order of the Purple Heart is a combat decoration awarded to members of the
Armed Forces of the United States who are wounded by an instrument of war in
the hands of the enemy and posthumously to the next of kin in the name Of those
who are killed in action or die of wounds received in action; and

During the 2014 Session, the Georgia General Assembly passed Senate Bill 276
which designates August 7 of every year as “Purple Heart Day”; and

On Purple Heart Day, residents of the state of Georgia are encouraged to
commemorate the day and honor those wounded or killed while serving in any
branch of the United States Armed Services; and

On Purple Heart Day 2014, we honor 42 fallen Guardsmen as we dedicate the
Freedom Calls Memorial Wall at the Clay National Guard Center, Marietta,
Georgia; and

It is fitting and proper to remember and honor our Purple Heart recipients who
sacrificed so much while serving in the United States Armed Services.

Now, THEREFORE, IN HONOR OF PURPLE HEART DAY AND AS A MARK OF
RESPECT FOR OUR PURPLE HEART RECIPIENTS, PURSUANT TO THE
AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT Is
HEREBY

That the ﬂag of the United States and the ﬂag Of the State of Georgia be ﬂown at
half—staff on the State Capitol building and grounds on Thursday, August 7, 2014,
until sunset.

This 6th day of August, 2014.

GOVERNOR
