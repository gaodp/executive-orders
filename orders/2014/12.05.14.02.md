THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

The transportation infrastructure of this State is integral to
its growing economy and providing jobs for Georgians; and

Providing for the maintenance and improvement of our
transportation infrastructure is dependent upon the
collection of taxes levied on the sale of motor fuel and
aviation gasoline; and

The significant volatility in the cost of gasoline will result in
an inconsistent level of funding available to ensure that the
State’s transportation network is adequately maintained and
able to grow to meet increasing needs of Georgia’s citizens
and industry; and

Georgia law authorizes the Governor to suspend the
collection of taxes, or any part thereof, due the state until the
meeting of the next General Assembly; and

Under these circumstances, providing for a stable and
continuous source of funding for improving and maintaining
the State’s transportation infrastructure is warranted.

NOW, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE
AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS GOVERNOR OF
THE STATE OF GEORGIA, AND BY SECTION 45-12-
22 OF THE OFFICIAL CODE OF GEORGIA
ANNOTATED, IT IS HEREBY

That the collection of any rate of prepaid state taxes as
defined in paragraph (24) of Section 48-8-2 of the Official
Code of Georgia Annotated, to the extent that it differs from
the rate levied as of July 1, 2014, pursuant to Section 48-9-14
of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, be suspended as it
applies to sales of motor fuel and aviation gasoline as those
