EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

FLAGS ON STATE BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS
ORDERED LowERED To HALF STAFF

On this solemn day thirteen years ago, radical extremists
perpetrated an irreparable harm on this Great Nation, murdering
nearly 3,000 of our citizens to terrorize the United States of
America; and

These senseless, cowardly attacks were intended to shake our
resolve, but in the wake of tragedy, the courage and bravery of our
patriotic citizens — first responders, police officers, firefighters, and
bystanders who offered assistance to victims — demonstrated to the
world that we forever remain a nation of unity, freedom, and
justice; and

During this time of reﬂection, we should offer up our thoughts and
prayers to the families and friends of those who lost loved ones and
to the men and women of our armed forces who continue to defend
the United States of America and protect all its citizens against the
threat of future attacks; and

To honor the memories of those who lost their lives and
memorialize this day in our nation’s history, the United States
Congress on December 18, 2001, passed by joint resolution Public
Law 107-89 (36 U.S.C. § 144), which designates September 11 of
each year as “Patriot Day.”

Now, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTIIORITY VESTED IN ME
AS GovERNoR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY
