EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS :

WHEREAS :

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

The State of Georgia has a vital interest in pursuing the most effective and efficient
processes of government for its citizens; and

Businesses and citizens depend on state government to operate in a cost effective and
efficient manner, providing services and support in a way that reduce burdens and
avoids creating any unreasonable impediment to the continued economic prosperity of
our state; and

The State of Georgia has been fortunate to have achieved and been recognized for such
efficiency in the past; and

Retaining and enhancing that reputation is key to attracting new investment and job
creation; and

State laws, regulations, permitting processes, and other requirements may often be time-
consuming, cumbersome and obstructive to business development and individuals; and

To best accomplish an efficient form of government, it is desirable that state agencies
reduce inefficiencies, redundancies, and consolidate all rules and regulations to make
them more responsive to small businesses and the citizens of Georgia.

N ow, THEREFORE, PURSUANT To THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS GovERNoR OF
THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That all statutory agencies under the purview of the Office of the Governor should
immediately review their respective rules and regulations to ensure they are not
imposing unnecessary burdens on individuals and businesses. Where agency findings
show that current rules produce undue and burdensome regulations, these agencies
should submit any and all proposed changes to my office for review by May 15, 2012.
Furthermore, in establishing future rules, agencies should continue to be cognizant of
the impact these rules have on businesses and individuals. Agencies should incorporate
“plain language” in drafting proposed rules so that they are clear, concise, and easily
understood by all those interacting with the State of Georgia.

This /-3 day of February, 2012.

 O 
GOVERNOR
