EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

Attest:

The State of Georgia holds title to certain real property consisting of approximately
979.92 acres by virtue of a December 31, 1941, Quitclaim Deed from United States of
America, acting by and through the Federal Works Administrator, recorded in Tattnall
County Clerk of Superior Court in Volume 4-U, Pages 87-94 (the “Property”); and

Said Property is in the custody of the Georgia Department of Corrections (the
“Department”) which thereon operates Georgia State Prison as depicted on Exhibit “A”,
attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference; and

Water Tower Number Two is located On the Property (the “Structure”), and said Structure
was found by the Department to have failure of both the interior and exterior coating
systems, penetrating rust throughout the exterior structure, and lead based paint; and

By resolution dated June 7, 2012, the Board of Corrections determined the cost to repair the
Structure far exceeds the cost of demolition, and authorized the Department’s
Commissioner to take all necessary steps, including execution of all necessary documents,
to request an Executive Order from the Governor to allow for the razing, demolition, and
disposal of the Structure; and

The Department has funding available to raze, demolish and dispose of said Structure.

Now, THEREFORE, PURSUANT To THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS GOVERNOR OF
THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

The Georgia Department of Corrections is hereby authorized and directed to provide for the
razing, demolition and disposal of said Structure under the terms and conditions which are
deemed to be in the best interests of the State of Georgia.

This 1‘ day of August, 2012.
