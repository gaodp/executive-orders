EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

The State of Georgia holds title to certain real property, by
virtue of a August 17, 1987 Warranty Deed from Walter W.
Resmondo and Theresa P. Resmondo, for approximately
2,588.4 acres, recorded in Toombs County Clerk of Superior
Court Deed Book 241, Pages 122-123 (the “Property”); and

The Property is improved with facilities known as “Joe
Kennedy Farms” speciﬁcally including the structure known as
“House Number Two—Old Jerry Davis House” or “Guest
House” (the “Structure”), as described in Exhibit “A”, attached
hereto and incorporated herein by reference; and

Said Property is in the custody of the Georgia Department of
Corrections; and

Two trees fell on the Structure causing the trusses to collapse
and the Structure to separate; and

On October 6, 2011, the Board of Corrections declared the
Structure to be surplus to its needs and more expensive to
repair than to demolish; resolved that the Commissioner of
Corrections is authorized to take all necessary steps including
execution of all necessary documents, to affect the demolition
of the Structure; and requested the State Properties
Commission seek an Executive Order from the Governor to
allow for the razing, demolition, and disposal of the Structure
as deemed to be in the best interest of the State of Georgia; and

The Georgia Department of Corrections has funding available
to raze, demolish, and dispose of said Structure.
