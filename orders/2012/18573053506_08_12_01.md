EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS :

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS :

WHEREAS :

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS :

ORDERED:

Motor fuels and aviation gasoline are essential commodities used by Georgians for
transportation; and

The price of gasoline has increased dramatically since the adjournment of the 2012
General Assembly; and

The increases in the cost of gasoline and other motor fuels have and will continue to
impose significant financial burdens on all Georgians and Georgia's businesses; and

This inﬂated cost can prevent Georgians from spending on other necessary goods
and business expansion; and

The significant increase in motor fuel prices will result in a Windfall to the State in the
form of surplus state taxes on these commodities; and

Georgia law authorizes the Governor to suspend the collection of taxes, or any part
thereof, due the State until the meeting of the next General Assembly; and

Under these circumstances, relief to the taxpayers of Georgia is warranted.

Now, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS GOVERNOR
OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, AND BY SECTION 45-12-22 OF THE OFFICIAL CODE
OF GEORGIA ANNOTATED, IT IS HEREBY

That the collection of any rate of prepaid state taxes as defined in paragraph (24) Of
Section 48-8-2 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, to the extent it differs from
the rate levied as of January 1, 2012, pursuant to Section 48-9-14 of the Official Code
of Georgia Annotated, be suspended as it applies to sales of motor fuel and aviation
gasoline as those terms are deﬁned in Section 48-9-2 of the Official Code of Georgia
Annotated, ending the last moment of December 31, 2012.

This 8 day of June, 2 0 1 2.
