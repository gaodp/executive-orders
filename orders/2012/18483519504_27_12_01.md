The quality of education of Georgia’s students is the top priority of
this State; and

This State will strive to provide quality education to every student
regardless of that student’s school district or school; and

Every school district and school in this State will be held to the
highest standard; and

Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 2o-2-72(a)(2), when a local school system or
school has been placed on the level of accreditation immediately
preceding loss of accreditation for school board governance related
reasons and does not retain full accreditation, the State Board of
Education shall recommend to the Governor whether to suspend all
members; and

Pursuant to this same code section, if the State Board of Education
makes a recommendation to suspend, the Governor may suspend
all members and appoint temporary replacement members; and

Under the provisions outlined above, the State Board of Education
has recommended to the Governor the suspension of all members
of the Miller County Board of Education; and

A non-partisan, non—political committee composed of education
professionals and advocates best ensures the highest quality of
replacement school board members.

GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY
