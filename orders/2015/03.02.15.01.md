EXECUTIVE ORDER

 

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

On February 27, 2015, in an effort to ensure the uninterrupted supply of poultry
products to residential and commercial establishments, Executive Order
02.27.15.01 was issued; and

The prolonged period of inclement weather disrupted the supply of the above
referenced products and has dramatically increased the need for additional
deliveries to residential and commercial customers; and

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations, 49 CFR 390, et seq., limit the hours
of operators of commercial motor vehicles may drive; and

49 CFR 390.23 allows the Governor of a State to suspend these rules and
regulations for up to 30 days if the Governor determines that an emergency
condition exists.

NOW, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That a State of Emergency is hereby declared in the following counties: Bartow,
Catoosa, Chatooga, Cherokee, Dade, Fannin, Floyd, Gilmer, Gordon, Murray,
Pickens, Polk, Walker and Whitﬁeld, for the limited purpose of suspending the
federal rules and regulations that limit the hours operators of commercial
vehicles may drive, in order to ensure the uninterrupted supply of poultry
products throughout Georgia. This emergency justiﬁes a suspension of Part 395
(drivers’ hours of service) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The
suspension that began at noon on Sunday, March 1, 2015, is hereby extended and
shall remain in effect until midnight on Friday, March 6, 2015. Nothing herein
shall be construed as an exemption from the Commercial Driver’s License
requirements in 49 CFR 383, the ﬁnancial requirements in 49 CFR 387, or
applicable federal size and weight limitations.

IT IS FURTHER
