THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

 

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

The uninterrupted supply of poultry products to residential and
commercial establishments is vital to Georgia’s economy; and

The continued period of inclement weather has interrupted the
supply of the above referenced products and has dramatically
increased the need for additional deliveries to residential and
commercial customers; and

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations, 49 CFR 390, et seq.,
limit the hours of operators of commercial motor vehicles may
drive; and

49 CFR 390.23 allows the Governor of a State to suspend these
rules and regulations for up to 30 days if the Governor determines
that an emergency condition exists.

Now, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME
AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That a State of Emergency is hereby declared for the limited
purpose of suspending the federal rules and regulations that limit
the hours operators of commercial vehicles may drive, in order to
ensure the uninterrupted supply of poultry products throughout
Georgia. This emergency justiﬁes a suspension of Part 395 (drivers’
hours of service) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The
suspension shall begin at noon on Sunday, March 1, 2015, and
remain in effect until noon on Tuesday, March 3, 2015. Nothing
herein shall be construed as an exemption from the Commercial
Driver’s License requirements in 49 CFR 383, the ﬁnancial
requirements in 49 CFR 387, or applicable federal size and weight
limitations.
