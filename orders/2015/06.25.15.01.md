THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

 

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

The continuous and efficient operation of state government data systems
is both Vital and necessary to the mission of providing governmental
services in Georgia; and

The Georgia Technology Authority and the various state agencies have the
responsibility for providing critically important, coordinated, robust and
effective information technology security in order to protect the state’s
data, to protect the citizens and to ensure the efficient operation of state
government; and

Information technology security risks continue to evolve and-grow, with
currently over a million cybersecurity events on state government systems
each day, which present a danger of disruption, costly financial damage
and even bodily harm if not adequately managed; and

Effective information technology security risk management requires inter-
agency coordination, reporting, training, sharing of data and information
about systems, and a consolidated view of the state’s risks, readiness,
constraints, priorities, and responsiveness to risk remediation; and .

It is in the best interest of the state to encourage coordination through the
engagement of the highest level of management at those state agencies
which are most directly involved in information technology risk reduction,
and to provide for a coordinated and structured review to ensure that state
government’s cybersecurity risks are being managed appropriately]

NOW, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That, there is created a State Government Systems Cybersecurity Review
Board (herein referred to as the Cybersecurity Board) to focus internally
on the protection and privacy of state data.

IT IS FURTHER
