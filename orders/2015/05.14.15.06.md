EXECUTIVE ORDER

 

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

The General Assembly passed Senate Bill 148 during the 2015 Legislative
Session which provides that the powers and responsibilities of the
Governor’s Ofﬁce of Consumer Affairs be transferred to the Attorney’s
General’s Office; and

The General Assembly passed House Bill 76, the Appropriations Act for
Fiscal Year 2016, during the 2015 Legislative Session, which provides a
separate program for Consumer Protection.

The Department of Law has similar positions and functions to those
previously held in the Governor’s Office of Consumer Protection in its
budgetary program that would be duplicative with two separate program
budgets; and

The consolidation of the Consumer Protection Program budget with the
Department of Law Program budget program will allow for a more
efficient and effective management of government.

NOW, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That, as of July 1, 2015, the Consumer Protection Program Budget will be
consolidated into the Department of Law Program Budget.

This [é day of May, 2015.

GOVERNOR
