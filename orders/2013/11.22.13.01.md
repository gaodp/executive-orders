EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

FLAGS ON STATE CAPITOL BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

ORDERED LOWERED TO HALF STAFF

A half century ago, the United States of America turned its
attention to Dallas, Texas as it mourned the loss of an
extraordinary public servant; and

In his three years as President, John F. Kennedy weathered
the perilous tests of the Cold War and ushered in a new wave
of American diplomacy during the Cuban Missile Crisis; and

While President Kennedy’s life was tragically cut short, his
legacy of service continues to inspire all Americans and
Georgians; and

It is fitting and proper to honor and remember President
Kennedy’s life on this American Day of Remembrance.

Now, THEREFORE, IN HONOR AND AS A MARK OF RESPECT
FOR THE MEMORY OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY,
PURSUANT To THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS GOVERNOR
OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That the ﬂag of the United States and the ﬂag of the State of
Georgia be ﬂown at half-staff on the State Capitol building
and grounds on Friday, November 22, 2013, until sunset.

This 22nd day of November, 2013.
