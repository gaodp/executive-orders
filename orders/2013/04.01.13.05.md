County, Georgia, (hereinafter the “Premises”), as more fully described

Effective July 1, 2011, the Georgia Agricultural Exposition Authority

The Georgia Agricultural Exposition Authority, at its meeting on
August 8, 2012, approved the transfer of custody and control of the

The Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture on or about
