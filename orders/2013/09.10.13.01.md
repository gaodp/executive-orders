EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

ORDERED:

Twelve years ago our nation was confronted with tragedy when thousands of our
own were sacriﬁced in the name of a senseless, hateful, inhuman ideal; and

As we continue to rebuild and repair what has been broken, we must
acknowledge that these efforts, while honorable, will forever be unfulfilled; the
World was devastatingly and irreparably changed on that September morning;
and

We can never replace those who perished, but their memories will forever be
present in our minds and hearts; and their sacrifice is immortalized in our
recognition of the sacred gift that is human life; and

TO honor the memories of those who lost their lives and memorialize this day in
our nation’s history, the United States Congress on December 18, 2001, passed by
joint resolution Public law 107-89 (36 U.S.C. §144), which designates September
11 of each year as “Patriot Day.”

Now, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That the State of Georgia recognize Wednesday, September 11, 2013, as Patriot
Day by flying the American Flag and the ﬂag of the Great State of Georgia at half-
staff on all state buildings and grounds. I also encourage all Georgians to display
the American Flag and the ﬂag of the State of Georgia at half—staff from their
homes and businesses.

IT IS FURTHER

That all Georgians are called upon to observe a moment of silence beginning at
8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor the innocent lives lost as a result of the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; and to lift up in prayer those who
continue to protect and defend the United States of America.

This 10”‘ day of September, 2013.
