THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

Over the past three years, the Special Council on Criminal Justice
Reform was successful in its study of the Georgia adult corrections
and juvenile justice systems as well as in its subsequent
recommendations to the General Assembly; and

In 2012, the General Assembly drafted House Bill 1176 based on the
recommendations of the Council and passed the bill unanimously;
and

In 2013, the General Assembly drafted House Bill 242 and House
Bill 349 based on the recommendations of the Council and passed
the bills overwhelmingly; and

House Bill 349 statutorily created the Georgia Council on Criminal
Justice Reform; and

I have tasked the Council with its first order of business being a
comprehensive review and subsequent policy recommendations to
improve reentry services and substantially reduce the recidivism
rates among both adult and juvenile populations.

NOW, THEREFORE, BY VIRTUE OF THE POWER VESTED IN
ME AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That, on July 1, 2013, the Governor’s Office of Transition, Support
and Reentry be created. The mission of the Governor’s Office of
Transition, Support and Reentry is to ensure successful offender
reentry to the State of Georgia, to reduce recidivism, to enhance
public safety through collaboration among stakeholders and to
assist in ensuring the appropriate and responsible use of cost
savings realized by justice reforms through reinvestment in
evidence—based, community-centered services.
