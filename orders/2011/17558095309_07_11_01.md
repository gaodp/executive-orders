A decade has passed since people from around the world
witnessed tragedy unfold as terrorists unleashed a cowardly
attack on the United States of America. Although the
wounds may have healed, the scars will always remain; and

As a nation, it is imperative that we remember the events of
the morning Of September 11, 2001. We should
commemorate not only the lives we lost, but also the acts of
bravery, courage and compassion shown by first responders,
ﬁreﬁghters, police Ofﬁcers and by~standers who offered
assistance during the wake of this tragedy; and

During this time of reﬂection, we should offer up our
thoughts and prayers to the families and friends of those who
lost loved ones and to the men and women Of our armed
forces who continue to defend the United States Of America
and protect all its citizens against the threat of future attacks;
and

To honor the memories of those who lost their lives and
memorialize this day in our natiOn’s history, the United
States Congress on December 18, 2001, passed by joint
resolution Public Law 107-89 (36 U.S.C. § 144), which
designates September 11 of each year as “Patriot Day.”

N Ow, THEREFORE, PURSUANT To THE AUTHORITY VESTED
IN ME AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS
HEREBY
