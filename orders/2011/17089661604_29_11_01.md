EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

On April 27, 2011 severe storms moved into the State of Georgia
producing tornadoes, hail and damaging winds which caused
extensive damages necessitating the declaration of a State of
Emergency; and

It is necessary to expedite the restoration of services and relief in
the impacted areas of the state due to this extraordinary situation;
and

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations, 49 CFR 390, et seq.,
limit the hours of operators of commercial motor vehicles may
drive; and

49 CFR 390.23 allows the Governor of a State to suspend these
rules and regulations for up to 30 days if the Governor determines
that an emergency condition exists.

NOW, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED
IN ME AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS
HEREBY

That a State of Emergency is hereby declared for the limited
purpose of suspending the federal rules and regulations that limit
the hours operators of commercial vehicles may drive, in order to
ensure the uninterrupted supply of emergency supplies, equipment,
commodities and resources to impacted areas of the State. This
emergency justiﬁes a suspension of Part 395 (drivers' hours of
service) of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The
suspension shall remain in effect for 30 days or until the emergency
condition ceases to exist, whichever is less. Nothing herein shall be
construed as an exemption from the Commercial Driver's License
requirements in 49 CFR 383, the ﬁnancial requirements in 49 CFR
387, or applicable federal size and weight limitations.
