EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

ORDERED:

The Georgia Forestry Commission has reported that wildﬁres in
Southeast Georgia and in particular Charlton County, have resulted
in the loss of thousands of acres of commercial timber, threatened
numerous communities, forced the closure of state highways, and
required the evacuation of residents; and

The short-term and long-term weather forecasts are for continued
patterns of dryness and strong winds which will promote the
creation of new wildﬁres and constrain the ability of the ﬁreﬁghters
to contain the existing ﬁres; and

Additional State assistance is necessary to protect the public health,
preserve the safety of the public, keep property damage to a
minimum and support the ﬁreﬁghters and public safety personnel
who are responding to this continuing threat to communities in the
path of these growing wildﬁres.

NOW, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY
VESTED IN ME AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF
GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That a State of Emergency exists in Charlton County.
IT IS FURTHER

That to facilitate the containment of these wildﬁres the Georgia
Forestry Commission continue to take necessary action to ensure
the expeditious containment, control and extinguishment of these
ﬁres.
