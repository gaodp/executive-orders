BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

An adequate supply of clean and affordable water is vital to
Georgia’S economic well-being and sustaining our high quality of
life; and

Communities across the state face short and long-term water supply
challenges; and

Enactment of the Water Stewardship Act (SB37o) in 2010 advanced
water conservation across the state, helping to create a culture of
water conservation in the state of Georgia; and

Georgia must now also support the development of new water
supply sources to supplement existing water conservation efforts;
and

Local governments and water utilities face considerable constraints
in ﬁnancing critical water infrastructure projects in today’s
economic climate; and

Various state agencies and authorities possess specialized powers
and expertise that can be aligned to support the development of
water supply facilities around the State.

Now, THEREFORE, BY VIRTUE OF THE POWER VESTED IN ME, AS
THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA) will
develop and implement the Governor’s Water Supply Program to
assist local governments in developing new sources of water supply
adequate to meet future water demand forecasts.

IT IS FURTHER
