WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

Georgia is proud that our history has been enriched by the presence of the military
and that the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard all currently have
installations in our state; and

These military facilities are vital both to our state’s economy and our natiOn’s
security; and

These facilities and the communities in which they are located deserve the support of
both the public and private sector as they contribute to our tax base, provide
thousands of jobs, and serve as home for many of our citizens; and

There are opportunities not only to strengthen our support for these military
communities but also to grow Georgia’s defense industry; and

Since it was ﬁrst established in 1994, our state has beneﬁtted from the work of the
Military Affairs Coordinating Committee.

Now, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AU'I‘HORITY VESTED IN ME AS GOVERNOR
OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That the Military Affairs Coordinating Committee shall be reappointed as of this day
and shall operate as an affiliate of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce as the leading
representative of the state’s business community.

This Committee, which shall be comprised of members of the public and private
sectors, as well as representatives of the military, shall work to maintain a strong
military presence in our state, to attract new economic development to our military
communities, and to build a broader base of support for the members of the military
and their families.
