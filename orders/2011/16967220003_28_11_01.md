Wildﬁres in Southeast Georgia have resulted in the loss of tens of
thousands of acres of commercial timber, threatened numerous
communities, forced the closure of state highways and community
schools, and required the evacuation of residents; and

On March 25, a State of Emergency was issued for Bacon, Clinch,
Coffee and Long Counties; and

the creation of new wildﬁres and constrained the ability of the
ﬁreﬁghters to contain the existing ﬁres; and

It is necessary to amend the State of Emergency issued March 25 to
include Ware County; and

Additional State assistance is necessary to protect the public health,

who are responding to this continuing threat to communities in the
path of these growing wildﬁres.
