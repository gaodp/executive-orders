THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

FLAGS ON STATE BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS

ORDERED LOWERED T0 HALF STAFF

“Freedom has its life in the hearts, the actions, the spirit of men and so it must be
daily earned and refreshed — else like a ﬂower cut from its life—giving roots, it
will wither and die.” — Dwight D. Eisenhower

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

On Memorial Day, Monday, May 30, 2011, Americans will
come together to celebrate the memory of the men and
women who have given their lives to defend the freedoms
enjoyed in the United States of America; and

The cost of freedom is high, and we must never forget the
sacriﬁces made by those who have bravely chosen to serve in
the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and
Coast Guard; and

Much like the duty to country exhibited by our military
personnel, the citizens of this country must make it their
duty to honor those who have passed away, and those who
continue to serve, with appropriate ceremonies, memorials,
and celebrations; and

As Georgians, we owe special recognition to 22 of our own
who have made the ultimate sacriﬁce in service to our
country since our last Memorial Day celebration. May God
bless those we lost, comfort those who lost their loved ones,
and protect those who continue to serve.

NOW, THEREFORE, IN HONOR AND AS A MARK OF RESPECT
FOR THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO HAVE MADE THE
ULTIMATE SACRIFICE IN DEFENSE OF OUR NATION,
