THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

ESTABLISHING A CODE OF ETHICS
FOR EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES

In order to maintain the public trust, it is essential that the government function
in a manner consistent with the highest ethical standards; and

In carrying out their ofﬁcial duties and obligations, all Ofﬁcers and employees of
state government must work solely for the public good, striving vigilantly to avoid
even the appearance that their actions are motivated by private or personal
interest; and

It is in the best interests of the State of Georgia that consistent policies on ethics
be applied to all executive Ofﬁcers and employees; and

State employees should use their powers and resources to further the public
interest and not for any ﬁnancial or other personal beneﬁt, other than salaried
compensation and employer—provided beneﬁts; and

State employees must safeguard their ability to make objective, fair, and
impartial decisions and therefore should not accept beneﬁts of any sort under
circumstances in which it could be inferred by a reasonable observer that the
beneﬁt was intended to inﬂuence a pending or future decision or to reward a past
decision; and

State employees must avoid any conduct, whether in the context of business,
ﬁnancial, or social relationships, which might undermine the public trust,
whether that conduct is unethical or lends itself to the appearance of ethical
impropriety.

N Ow, THEREFORE, BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME AS GOVERNOR OF THE
STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That the Executive Order establishing a Code of Ethics for Executive Branch
Ofﬁcers and Employees of January 13, 2003, is hereby renewed and the following
ethics policies shall remain in effect.
