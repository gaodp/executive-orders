THE STATE OF GEORGIA

EXECUTIVE ORDER

BY THE GOVERNOR:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS 3

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS:

ORDERED:

ORDERED:

ORDERED:

Wildﬁres in Southeast Georgia have resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of acres of
commercial timber, threatened numerous communities, forced the closure of state
highways, and required the evacuation of residents; and

On June 14, a State of Emergency was issued for Charlton County; and

The continued patterns of dryness and strong winds have promoted the creation of new
wildﬁres and constrained the ability of the ﬁreﬁghters to contain the existing ﬁres; and

It is necessary to amend the State of Emergency issued June 14 to include Brantley
County; and

Additional State assistance is necessary to protect the public health, preserve the safety
of the public, keep property damage to a minimum and support the ﬁreﬁghters and
public safety personnel who are responding to this continuing threat to communities in
the path of these growing wildﬁres.

NOW, THEREFORE, PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AS
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IT IS HEREBY

That a State of Emergency exists in Charlton and Brantley Counties.

IT Is FURTHER

That to facilitate the containment of these wildﬁres the Georgia Forestry Commission
continue to take necessary action to ensure the expeditious containment, control and
extinguishment of these ﬁres.

IT IS FURTHER

That all resources of the State of Georgia be made available to assist in the response and
recovery activities associated with the Southeast Georgia Wildﬁres and that the Georgia

Emergency Management Agency activate the Georgia Emergency Operations Plan.

This 16”! day of June, 2011.
