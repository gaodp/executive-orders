## Georgia Executive Orders Archive

Executive orders are an important part of the heartbeat of any government. In Georgia, those
executive orders are published online, but are stored in scanned PDF files that aren't searchable
by Google or useful for analysis by computer software. To boot, the Georgia government recently had
a debacle where [all the orders mysteriously disappeared for a few days](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/08/06/the-case-of-the-missing-executive-orders-a-lack-of-transparency-in-georgias-government/)
In response to this, the Georgia Executive Orders Archive was created as a program of the Georgia
Open Data Project.
