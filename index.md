## Georgia Executive Orders Archive

Executive orders are an important part of the heartbeat of any government. In Georgia, those
executive orders are published online, but are stored in scanned PDF files that aren't searchable
by Google or useful for analysis by computer software. To boot, the Georgia government recently had
a debacle where [all the orders mysteriously disappeared for a few days](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/08/06/the-case-of-the-missing-executive-orders-a-lack-of-transparency-in-georgias-government/)
In response to this, the Georgia Executive Orders Archive was created as a program of the Georgia
Open Data Project.

This archive includes code developed by GAODP that leverages open source projects like PhantomJS,
GhostScript, and Tesseract to retrieve and parse the text content of the executive orders in an
automated fashion. Using this method, we have successfully retrieved and parsed all orders through
2011. We have an eye toward improving that parsing so we can pull out additional metadata about
each order - such as the summary title and date as depicted on ga.gov. We also are investigating
pulling in orders dating back to 2003.

This archive is an open source project, and the code is licensed under the Apache 2 License. Please
