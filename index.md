## Georgia Executive Orders Archive

Executive orders are an important part of the heartbeat of any government. In Georgia, those
executive orders are published online, but are stored in scanned PDF files that aren't searchable.
To help assist in the research and archival of Executive orders, the Executive Orders Archive
was created as a product of the Georgia Open Data Project to publish executive orders in a
searchable, text form and provide a redundant copy of the PDF versions of executive orders.

This project is implemented using GitHub pages, and we make copies of the original executive
orders available via PDF, stored on Amazon S3.
